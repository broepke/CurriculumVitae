\maketitle

\vspace{-6ex}
As an accomplished leader with an extensive data science, analytics, and product management background, I am excited to explore opportunities to lead and manage cross-functional data teams. With a record of delivering high-value solutions, I have successfully led teams of data scientists, analysts, and data engineers to transform organizations into data-driven entities. Most recently, as the Director of Analytics \& Insights at Autodesk, I spearheaded the standardization of a modern data stack, resulting in significant performance improvements and user satisfaction. I've delivered multiple innovative machine-learning production solutions, including an MLOps platform. My expertise in product management and dedication to human-centered design help set me apart from others in my field, given my track record of building products and businesses.
