\maketitle

\vspace{-6ex}
I lead an Analytics \& Insights team for a large cloud platform. We are a group of passionate Data Scientists and Analysts that enable data-driven decision-making through insights that optimize the platform's business, product, and cost.  I have an extensive background in Product Management that I leverage to deliver everything I do, from Data Sets, to ML pipelines, to Dashboards as products. I am a certified practitioner of Human-Centered Design and love utilizing its methods and techniques to bring out the best in people and build the most innovative, inclusive solutions. I focus on delivering high value, great user experience, and the right outcomes.
